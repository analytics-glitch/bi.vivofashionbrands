# Vivo Fashion Group — BI Dashboard PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Comprehensive BI dashboard for Vivo Fashion Group (East Africa). Proxies a third-party Vivo BI API and surfaces it through multiple authenticated, filterable tabs.

## Hard Product Rules
- **Theme**: Light orange background, dark/bright green accents.
- **Currency**: ALL currency shown in `KES` with thousands separators. Never use `$`.
- **Single source of truth**: Upstream API. KPIs across pages must agree (shared `/api/kpis` fetch).
- **Auth**: Emergent Google OAuth + JWT. PII masked by role.
- **Dopamine Design**: Streaks, badges, celebration micro-interactions, conversational briefings, actionable subtitles on every KPI (metric-action contract).
- **`total_sales`** is the canonical top-level revenue field (gross minus discounts). Do **not** swap to `net_sales` on global KPIs unless explicitly requested.

## Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind + Recharts
- Backend: FastAPI + httpx (single shared `AsyncClient` with `Limits(max_connections=200, max_keepalive_connections=50)` and `Timeout(read=45, connect=10, pool=15)`)
- DB: MongoDB (auth, notifications, recommendations state, leaderboard snapshots, activity logs)
- LLM: `emergentintegrations` + Claude (Emergent LLM Key) for `/api/ask` natural-language search

## Key Backend Modules
- `server.py` — FastAPI proxy + analytics (>2600 lines, refactor candidate)
- `auth.py`, `pii.py`, `chat.py`, `leaderboard.py`, `recommendations.py`, `user_activity.py`
- `thumbnails.py`, `notifications.py`, `search.py`, `ask.py`

## Key API Endpoints
`/api/kpis`, `/api/sales-summary`, `/api/inventory`, `/api/customers`, `/api/customers/walk-ins`, `/api/footfall`, `/api/data-freshness`, `/api/top-skus`, `/api/sor`, `/api/analytics/sor-new-styles-l10`, `/api/analytics/sales-projection`, `/api/analytics/ibt-suggestions`, `/api/analytics/sell-through-by-location`, `/api/analytics/weeks-of-cover`, `/api/analytics/inventory-summary`, `/api/analytics/churn`, `/api/analytics/new-styles`, `/api/analytics/category-country-matrix`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/notifications/unread-count`, `/api/search`, `/api/ask`, `/api/recommendations/*`, `/api/thumbnails/*`

## Implemented (highlights)

## Recently Shipped (2026-04-26 / 27)
- **Walk-in capture leaderboard** (Locations page): New `LocationsCaptureRatePanel` shows Top 3 stores by capture rate (celebrate) and Bottom 3 (coach this week). Reuses the `/api/customers/walk-ins` payload at zero extra upstream cost — backend now also returns `by_location` (channel-keyed walk-in orders, total orders, share, capture rate). Stores with < 50 orders excluded so single-checkout pop-ups don't drag the bottom list. Empty state for low-volume periods.
- **Walk-ins KPI** (`/api/customers/walk-ins`): counts anonymous orders per period (detection rule = `customer_type IN ('Guest','Walk-in','Anonymous') OR customer_id IS NULL`), with per-country and per-location breakdowns. Endpoint chunks `/orders` into ≤30-day windows so long ranges don't hit the upstream's 50k row cap. Cold ~30-45 s, warm ~200 ms (cached 120 s). New `[data-testid="kpi-walk-ins"]` tile on Customers page (now 6-col KPI grid) + `Walk-ins · by country` sortable card, both honour the global `compareMode` for ▲/▼ deltas.
- **Category × Country Matrix** (`/api/analytics/category-country-matrix`, new `Country Matrix` sub-tab inside Products): rows = subcategories, cols = Kenya / Uganda / Rwanda / Online, cells = `KES X (Y% of {country})` where Y% is the subcategory's share of THAT country's total. Sortable by any column, sticky country-totals footer row, CSV export. Built on a new `footerRow` prop in `SortableTable.jsx`.
- **httpx pool fix**: Bumped shared client to `max_connections=200, max_keepalive_connections=50`, decoupled `pool=15s` from `read=45s` so transient pool saturation falls back to the `_kpi_stale_cache` instead of surfacing "PoolTimeout: timed out after 2 attempts" on the Overview banner.
- **Deployment readiness audit**: Passed via Deployer Agent (no blockers, no warnings).
- **Customers page latency fix**: Split slow upstream `/churned-customers?limit=100000` (≈30 s, frequent 503s) out of `/api/customers` into a dedicated non-blocking `/api/customers/churn-rate` endpoint with a 60 s negative cache. `/api/customers` cold: 38 s → 5.5 s. Churn tile shows "computing…" until ready.
- **Universal upstream response cache** in `fetch()` (TTL 120 s, bounded 2000 entries, cleared via `/api/admin/cache-clear`). Every page after first warm-up loads in <1 s end-to-end:
  - Overview: 1.17 s → **0.19 s**
  - Products: 4.51 s → **0.17 s**
  - Inventory: 15.54 s → **1.01 s**
  - Footfall: 2.01 s → **0.13 s**
  - Customers: 1.47 s → **0.14 s**
- **Deployment loop fix**: `.gitignore` was excluding `.env / .env.* / *.env` (two duplicate blocks at lines 94-96 and 113-115). Removed so Emergent's deployer can pick up the env files for production substitution. Also bounded `/api/admin/users` query to `.limit(1000)`.
- **New global filter bar**: replaced the flat preset+date row on every page with three pill buttons:
  - **Date Range pill** — calendar icon + selected-label + chevron, opens a 640px panel with a left preset sidebar (Today, Yesterday, Last 7/30/90/365 days, Last week/month/quarter/12 months/year, Month-to-date, Quarter-to-date, Year-to-date, Custom) and a right-side dual-month `Calendar` (range mode), date inputs with → arrow, disabled time picker, Cancel + Apply buttons.
  - **Comparison Period pill** — dropdown with `No comparison / Yesterday / Previous year / Previous year (match day of week) / Custom`. Custom reveals two date inputs + apply.
  - **Currency pill** — KES, disabled with tooltip "Multi-currency coming soon — KES locked for now" (cosmetic only per current scope).
  - **Mobile**: all three pills + Country/POS multi-selects collapse into a single "Filters" pill that opens a bottom-sheet.
  - URL params persist `p, d, t, co, ch, cm, cd, ce, cu` (also accepts long names `period, date_from, date_to, country, pos, compare, compare_from, compare_to, currency` for shareable links).
  - Default compareMode changed from `last_month` → `none`.
- **Overview page reorder**: KPI cards / sub-KPIs / charts / location-channel breakdown table now render at the top; an "Insights & Projections" divider separates the below-the-fold section (DailyBriefing → WhatChangedBelt → WinsThisWeekCard → StoreOfTheWeek → SalesProjection → DataFreshness).
- **Channel segmentation toggle (All / Retail / Online)** — segmented control placed right of the Date Range pill, reachable on every page. State persists in URL via `cg` (`channel_group` in shareable links) and survives refreshes / cross-page navigation. Selection drives the `effectiveChannels` derived list which flows through every API call via existing `buildParams(applied)`. **Manual channel multi-select still wins** when populated. Retail = channels NOT matching `/online/i`; Online = channels matching `/online/i`.
- **Active POS list fetch is now auth-gated** — `/analytics/active-pos` is only requested AFTER `useAuth().user` is set, so the Retail toggle no longer shipped an empty channel list because of pre-login 401s.
- **Bar/table chart enhancements** — five Overview charts (Sales by Location [renamed], Country Split, Channel Split, Sales by Category, Sales by Subcategory) now render `KES X (Y%) ▲▼Z%` inline labels via the new `makePctDeltaLabel` helper in `ChartHelpers.jsx`. Green for positive, red for negative, grey dash for ~zero, hidden when compareMode = `none`. Memos extended with `delta_pct` from `salesPrev` / `countrySummaryPrev` / `subcatsPrev`.
- **"Previous month"** restored as a Compare option (between Yesterday and Previous year).
- **Top-row KPI grid** is now 6-tile (Total Sales / Net Sales / Total Orders / Total Units Sold / Total Footfall / Conversion Rate) — the redundant Footfall row that appeared after the sub-KPIs has been removed.

## Roadmap
### P1 — Refactor
- Break up `/app/backend/server.py` (>2600 lines) into routers: `routers/sales.py`, `routers/inventory.py`, `routers/analytics.py`, `routers/customers.py`.

### P2
- Margin reporting (gross margin at category & product level)
- Proper FX handling via `dim_fx_rate` for UGX / RWF → KES

### P3
- Wire L-10 SOR action choices `{Reorder · Markdown · IBT · Hold}` into `recommendations_state`
- In-memory caches (`_kpi_stale_cache`, `_churn_full_cache`) → migrate to Mongo / Redis if multi-replica deploy is planned (currently single-replica safe)
